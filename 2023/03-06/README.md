<hr/>
<p>The ship is departing from a recent stop at a space station where you took on-board new supplies for the trip. The captain has asked you to process all the goods in the loading bay and ensure it has been properly logged by the ship&#x27;s master inventory system. Fortunately all the goods have barcodes on them that allow you to determine what they contain. You quickly scan all the codes into your computer (your input data). The scans provide three items of information: A unique item number, a quantity, and the category of the goods.</p>
<p>In order to confirm the inventory has been processed correctly, your task is:</p>
<ol>
<li>To sum the total quantity brought on board for each category of supplies.</li>
<li>Once you have the totals, find the modulus of 100 for each category total.</li>
<li>Calculate the product of all those values.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should match the verification value from the inventory computer.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>For this worked example, let&#x27;s start with an extract of the input data:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The first step to verifying the inventory computer has properly recorded the stock items, is to determine the total quantity for each individual category. Using the above data, you would get the following totals:</p>
<pre><code>Food: 85690 units
Frozen: 28211 units
Water: 59545 units
Fuel: 62686 units
Mechanical: 83749 units
</code></pre>
<p>Having the totals for each category <em>(note there might be additional categories in the input data)</em>, take the modulus of 100 for each category.</p>
<pre><code>85690 % 100 = 90
28211 % 100 = 11
59545 % 100 = 45
62686 % 100 = 86
83749 % 100 = 49
</code></pre>
<p>Now find the product of those values.</p>
<pre><code>90 * 11 * 45 * 86 * 49 = 187733700
</code></pre>
<p>In this example 187733700 would be the answer.</p>
<h2>Your task</h2>
<p>Perform your verification calculations and if you get the same answer as the inventory computer, then you know the stock has been properly recorded!</p></div><div class="SolutionBox"><h2>Input data</h2><p>Get your <a href="/api/puzzledata?puzzle=18" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">puzzle input data</a></p><h2>What is the solution?</h2><div><input type="text" class="solution" placeholder="Your answer" value=""/>Â <input type="button" class="solutionButton" value="Submit"/></div><div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"id":"18","available":true,"fullname":"Inventory check","content":"The year is 2223 and you are completing your apprenticeship on the Starship Turing.
